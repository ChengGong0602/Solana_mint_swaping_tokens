# Vera on Solana

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript
API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to
interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain VERA program

## Quick Start

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending
on your OS, they may already be installed:

- Install node (v14 recommended)
- Install npm
- Install the latest Rust stable from https://rustup.rs/
- Install Solana v1.7.11 or later from
  https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

If this is your first time using Rust, these [Installation
Notes](README-installation-notes.md) might be helpful.

### Configure CLI

> If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run these commands

1. Set CLI config url to localhost cluster

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

2. Create CLI Keypair

If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

### Start local Solana cluster

This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Start a local Solana cluster:
```bash
solana-test-validator
```
> **Note**: You may need to do some [system tuning](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#system-tuning) (and restart your computer) to get the validator to run

Listen to transaction logs:
```bash
solana logs
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

There is both a Rust and C version of the on-chain program, whichever is built
last will be the one used when running the example.

```bash
npm run build:solana-vera
```

### Deploy the on-chain program

```bash
solana program deploy dist/program/vera.so
```

### Run the JavaScript client

```bash
npm run start
```


## Pointing to a public Solana cluster

Solana maintains three public clusters:
- `devnet` - Development cluster with airdrops enabled
- `testnet` - Tour De Sol test cluster without airdrops enabled
- `mainnet-beta` -  Main cluster

Use the Solana CLI to configure which cluster to connect to.

To point to `devnet`:
```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

To point back to the local cluster:
```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

## Expand your skills with advanced examples

There is lots more to learn; The following examples demonstrate more advanced
features like custom errors, advanced account handling, suggestions for data
serialization, benchmarking, etc...
